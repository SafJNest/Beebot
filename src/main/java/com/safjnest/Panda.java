 * Hear the legends of the Kung Fu Panda!
Raised in a noodle shop, never seeking glory or fame,
He climbed a mountain top and earned the Dragon Warrior name.
Ooh Ah Ya!

Master Shifu saw the warrior blossom,
And master the skills of bodacious and awesome!
Kung Fu Panda!
He lives and he trains and he fights with the Furious Five,
Protect the valley something, something, something, something alive!
Ooh Ah Ya!
Kung Fu Panda!
Legends of Awesomeness.
